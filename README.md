# ECS30-list
C program that reads coordinates from stdin into a list and prints them out. list.h is the header file, list.c is the file with all the function implementations, list_driver.c tests the functions within list.c.

To test the code, use list_driver.c to test it. First compile list.c and list_driver.c to produce object files by using gcc with the -c flag. Then compile the object files and create an executable.
